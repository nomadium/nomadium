[[!meta title="Miguel Landaeta"]]

Just a guy at Buenos Aires, Argentina. I have a day job at
[Restorando](http://www.restorando.com) as software developer (my official
title currently is Operations Engineer) focused and specialized on
scalability, automation, infrastructure issues and capacity planning.

On the side, in my spare time I like to hack, debug, learn, teach,
collaborate and participate in free software development and activities.
I'm currently involved in [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), particularly with
Java, Ruby and Python modules teams. I'm an
[official developer](https://db.debian.org/search.cgi?id=&authtoken&uid=nomadium&dosearch=Search...)
of that project.

Outside computers and other software stuff, I like to learn languages as hobby
so I'm learning German...  Ich kann ein bisschen Deutsch sprechen.

I'm also a big big fan of indie rock bands and I have an significant
interest on Economics but I haven't persuit any formal training on this
social science yet. Time will tell, who knows?
