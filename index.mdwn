[[!meta title="Miguel Landaeta"]]

Just a guy at Caracas, Venezuela. I have a day job at
[Open English](http://www.openenglish.com) as software developer (though my job
involves so many sysadmin duties) focused and specialized on scalability,
infrastructure issues and capacity planning.

On the side, in my spare time I like to hack, debug, learn, collaborate and
participate in free software development and activities. Currently involved
in [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), particularly with Java and Python modules
teams as unofficial maintainer.

Outside computers and other software stuff, I like to learn languages as hobby
so I'm learning German...  Ich kann ein bisschen Deutsch sprechen.


So, what you can find in this particularly irrelevant website?

* Some [[code]] I have written
* <del>My cats' pictures</del>
* An [[aggregator of me|grep]] on the web (perfect for stalkers and the like)
* [[Sandbox]] (every wiki have to have one, right?)
* [PGP key](http://keyserver.pgp.com/vkd/DownloadKey.event?keyid=0x6E608B637D8967E9)
