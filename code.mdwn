Regarding [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), all my packaging work is available
on [git.debian.org](http://git.debian.org), under pkg-java and collab-maint and
folders. There are also some legacy subversion repositores on
[svn.debian.org](http://svn.debian.org).

The list of packages that I'm currently mantaining can be found at
[qa.debian.org](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=nomadium@debian.org).
