So far nothing to show here about my personal projects.
Overcoming procrastination in order to complete something.

Regarding [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), all my packaging work is available
on [git.debian.org](http://git.debian.org), under pkg-java, collab-maint and
users/nomadium-guest folders.

The list of packages that I'm currently mantaining can be found at
[qa.debian.org](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=miguel@miguel.cc).
