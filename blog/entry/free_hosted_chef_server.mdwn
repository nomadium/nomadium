[[!meta title="Free Chef server hosted at api.qirtaiba.org"]]

Since months ago I was pondering over providing an alternative [Chef][chef]
hosted service.

The timing of the [recent announcement by Chef, Inc.][announcement] converging
and releasing a single code base under Apache 2.0 license for Chef server
certainly makes this initiative even more interesting for me.

So, I wanted to see if there is interest in such thing and I went ahead to
setup this service.

The service is free to use and is available at [api.qirtaiba.org][qirtaiba].

The service is beta but you are more than invited to use it.

I look forward to hear comments and see what the people think about it.
You can [drop me a line][email] or a [tweet][twitter] if you wish.

Let's hack and automate.
