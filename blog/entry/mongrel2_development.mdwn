In my opinion you can learn a lot [following the development process][zedshaw]
of [Mongrel2][mongrel2]. Mongrel2 is a redesign of Mongrel web server and it
is a project that have as goal to provide an application, language, and network
architecture agnostic web server.

This is probably the most interesting project that I could find right now on
the web, because it is under heavy development, it is using new concepts and
ideas, it is written in C ([very clear and legible code][commit] if you ask
me), the development process is totally in the open, and this could benefit
many people if successfully achieve its goal.

Because of that, and because of the very big bold goal of this project I'm
following its progress, I'm testing it and I plan to contribute with Mongrel2
if possible. By now, I'm only contributing from the distribution side of
things, so I prepared some packages necessary to test Mongrel2 in Debian
(despite Mr. Zed Shaw is very critic of the ``slowness'' of Linux distributions
picking new software).

Anyway, below are some links to binary and source packages for Mongrel2 and a
couple of dependencies, if anyone besides me is interested in testing this
in Debian (or Ubuntu). I already asked for review to have those packages
included officially in Debian.

* mongrel2:
  [binary][mongrel2_binary], [source][mongrel2_source], [git][mongrel2_git],
  [upstream][mongrel2_upstream].

* python-storm (needed to use m2sh):
  [binary][storm_binary], [source][storm_source], [git][storm_git],
  [upstream][storm_upstream].

* python-zmq (needed to run the examples included with mongrel2):
  [binary][pyzmq_binary], [source][pyzmq_source], [git][pyzmq_git],
  [upstream][pyzmq_upstream].
