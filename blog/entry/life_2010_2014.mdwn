[[!meta title="life: 2010-2014"]]

Wow, it looks like the last time I blogged something here was like 3 years
and 7 months or so.

In that period many things had changed but the most relevant event were:

* I don't live anymore in Venezuela.

* I became a Debian Developer.

Another important things happened on my personal life but they don't belong
on this blog anyway.

It feels good to write something again even if it's absolutely irrelevant
in the great scheme of things.
