[[!meta title="nomadium APT repository"]]

Well, the reason why I revived this blog (again) was because I wanted
to document the fact I setup what I expect to be an stable APT repo
for packages prepared by myself but not ready to be included in Debian
for whatever reason at the moment.

It's available at:
[http://people.debian.org/~nomadium/apt/](http://people.debian.org/~nomadium/apt/).

Right now I'm working in some projects and I'm using some software
that is outdated, just not available on Debian stable suite or
on stable backports, e.g.:

* chef (>= 11.8)
* docker.io
* mosh

So, I decided to backport and upload those packages (and their
dependencies) there. Maybe somebody else can find uses for that
until they are included in the next stable release.
