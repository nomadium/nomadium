[[!meta title="ikiwiki + github pages = EPIC win!"]]

Since a while ago I was aware of the possibility of hosting an ikiwiki
generated website at github using [github pages][github_pages].
This is described with great detail on [tips section of ikiwiki website]
[ikiwiki_tips].

Later, it was [announced the possibility of using custom domains]
[github_pages_cname] with github pages, but unfortunately this feature was
available only to paying customers. Don't get me wrong, github is fantastic
and they provide a service really worth paying for (especially for private
projects), but for a [dollar starved guy like me][cadivi], I try to
avoid any expense in foreign currency.

So, it was cool to find out that the custom domain feature for github pages
now is free. I decided to give a try and migrate this website hosting there.
I could save a few bucks with hosting and gained the feature of updating my
website using git standard tools (pretty awesome and convenient if you ask me,
with one push you can publish updates or revert changes).

I'm going to investigate options about how to implement the dynamic portion of
ikiwiki (ikiwiki.cgi, and maybe comments), but for now my main use case of
ikiwiki is covered with github pages provided hosting.
